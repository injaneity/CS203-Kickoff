App motivations and overview:
Kickoff is a community-led football tournament management platform connecting clubs and players across Singapore. It addresses the limited opportunities for organizing and joining local football tournaments.

Key Components

Administrators (Admin)
	•	Verification: Kickoff admins verify tournaments, ensuring hosts manage logistics, venue bookings, and essentials.
	•	Enforcement: Hosts or players violating guidelines can be blacklisted or banned.

Players
	•	Profiles: Players can register, set preferences (position: forward, defender, midfielder and goalkeeper), and display availability.
	•	Free Agents: Unaffiliated players are labeled as “free agents” and can be recruited by clubs.

Clubs
	•	Management: Clubs are led by a captain, who coordinates participation in tournaments when enough players are available.
	•	Rank & History: Clubs have a public ELO rating and match history, allowing transparent team tracking.

ELO System
	•	Kickoff adapts the Glicko rating system, an enhanced ELO system with rating deviation, ensuring fair matchmaking.
	•	The ELO System also takes into account score difference when calculating change.

Tournament Matchmaking
	•	Seeding: ELO ranks are used for tournament seeding, rewarding top performers with more favorable matchups.
	•	Transparency: Club rankings are visible prior to tournament draws, providing confidence in fair match setups.
	•	Bracket formation is done by Kickoff automatically when a tournament is started, ensuring fairness and no collaborations between clubs.

Hosts
	•	Hosts (either clubs or independent) can organize tournaments, customize formats, set entry requirements, and add prize pools via in-app distribution.
	•	Currently, Hosts are required to pay a verification fee of SGD $5 to verify their tournament, to prevent bots from creating multiple "fake" tournaments. This is to respect the time of our players and clubs, who want to attend a legitimate tournament.
	•	Booking of event venue must be done before creating a tournament in the Kickoff web application. A screenshot proof of the booking must be submitted as part of the verification process.

Blacklisting or Bans
	•	Administrators can perform a blacklist or ban on both users and clubs, depending on their behaviour.
	•	Clubs who have been reported as playing unfairly or aggressively can be banned from entering future tournaments for a set amount of time that is determined by the administrator, depending on the severity of the offence.
	•	Users who have been reported can also be banned by an administrator and will cause their entire club to be unable to enter future tournaments until they are unbanned.
	•	However, for both clubs and users, bans or blacklists will not affect currently ongoing tournaments, or tournaments that they have already signed up for.

Leaderboard
	•	Clubs who reach a specific ELO threshold will obtain a border as recognition of their skill level.
	•	The higher the ELO of the club, the border becomes prettier and flashier.
